# [WIP] TinyMSX

## WIP status

It's not even close to being a concept yet.
I'm going to identify TODO while I'm building it.
Since creating an MSX emulator first would result in a redundant configuration, it is envisioned that I will initially aim to develop SG-1000 emulation and then MSX binary compatible.

## What is TinyMSX

TinyMSX is not MSX.
TinyMSX is a minimal hardware & software configuration MSX to run MSX cartridge software.
If anything, the image of an SG-1000 (1KB memory capacity) with an additional 16KB of memory may be accurate.
