## What is TinyMSX

TinyMSX is not MSX.
TinyMSX is a minimal hardware & software configuration MSX to run MSX cartridge software.
It's like the SG-1000 with MSX compatible.

Normally, you will need a BIOS that is copyrighted by Microsoft to work with MSX past assets.
WebMSX is provided online as the legal workaround, but it is not possible to provide in a standalone.
Because to get a stand-alone, the BIOS must be built-in.

The goal of this project is to provide a minimal library to provide a range of MSX past assets that do not utilize the some of BIOS and hardwares in a standalone configuration that can be sold on Steam and others.
