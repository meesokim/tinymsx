# [WIP] TinyMSX

## WIP status

It's not even close to being a concept yet.
I'm going to identify TODO while I'm building it.
Since creating an MSX emulator first would result in a redundant configuration, it is envisioned that I will initially aim to develop SG-1000 emulation and then MSX binary compatible.

## What is TinyMSX

TinyMSX is not MSX.
TinyMSX is a minimal hardware & software configuration MSX to run MSX cartridge software.
It's like the SG-1000 with MSX compatible.

Normally, you will need a BIOS that is copyrighted by Microsoft to work with MSX past assets.
WebMSX is provided online as the legal workaround, but it is not possible to provide in a standalone.
Because to get a stand-alone, the BIOS must be built-in.

The goal of this project is to provide a minimal library to provide a range of MSX past assets that do not utilize the some of BIOS and hardwares in a standalone configuration that can be sold on Steam and others.
